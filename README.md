# Introduction

MoviPedia is a simple webpage for movie exploration that developed using the React framework. This page is designed for users to browse movies based on genre and year. Additionally, users can view more details of the movies, which are redirected to the TMDB website. This page was integrated with the public TMDB API to fetch real-time data, including the movie's title, release year, genre, description and rating. The development of this page served as the purpose of enhancing my familiarity with React components and gaining the knowledge about fetching data using an API.
